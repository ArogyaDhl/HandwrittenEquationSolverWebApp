# HandwrittenEquationSolverWebApp
A Web app that solves solves the equation written on the drawing board. This implementation can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, square root and other mathematical operations.
The website can be found live at <a href='https://arogyad.herokuapp.com/' target='_blank'> here</a>. This website is hosted on heroku's free tier so it is very slow (which cause it to not provide the correct predictions and answers). I recommend you to clone the repo and try it out for yourself.
